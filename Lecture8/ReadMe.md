# Apna College Python Course  
## Lecture 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)  

This repository contains practice questions from **Lecture 8** of the **Apna College Python Course**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** in Python.  

---

### Concepts Covered:  
- **Introduction to OOPs**: Understanding the need for Object-Oriented Programming.  
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and using objects from user-defined classes.  
- **Constructors (`__init__` method)**: Initializing objects with attributes.  
- **Instance and Class Variables**: Understanding object-specific and shared data.  
- **Methods in Classes**: Defining and calling instance methods.  
- **Encapsulation**: Using private and public variables.  
- **Inheritance**: Implementing parent-child relationships between classes.  
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and operator overloading.  
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details using abstract methods.  
- **`super()` Keyword**: Accessing parent class methods and constructors.  

This lecture builds a strong foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming**, enabling better code organization and reusability in Python. ðŸš€
